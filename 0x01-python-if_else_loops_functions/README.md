##Writing a Python program that will assign a random signed number to the variable 'number' each time it is executed and completing the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable 'numbe'r is positive or negative.

##Writing a Python program that will assign a random signed number to the variable 'number' each time it is executed and completing the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable 'number'.

##Writing a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase not followed by a new line.

##Writing a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase not followed by a new line - print all the letters except 'q' and 'e'.

##Writing a Python program that prints all the numbers from '0' to '98' in decimal and hexadecimal.

##Writing a Python program that prints numbers from '0' to '99'.

##Writing a Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

##Writing a Python Function that checks for lowercase letters - returns true if 'c' is lower otherwise false.

##Completing the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative - program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.

##Completing the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number - program will assign a random number signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.

##Writing a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal using only one loop.

##Writing a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 - numbers should be printed in ascending order and a new line added at the end of the last number.

##Writing a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits - printing only the smallest combination of two digits and a new line added after the last number.

##Writing a Python Function that checks for lowercase character - returns true if c is lowercase, false if otherwise.
